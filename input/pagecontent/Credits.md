We recognize the HL7 guidance from the [Clinical Interoperability Council](https://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/cic/index.cfm) and [Mobile Health](https://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/mobile/index.cfm) Work Groups.

The development of this IG was sponsored by the [CodeX™ FHIR Accelerator](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/COD/CodeX+Home), a member-driven community working together to enable FHIR-based interoperability that drives substantial improvements around the most important challenges and opportunities in patient health.
